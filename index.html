                <h1>1. Discover Nature</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Norway's highlights are primarily its agricultural make-up.
                    The country has a wide variety of landscapes from islands and 
                    fjords to forests, lakes, and waterfalls.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    When traveling this vast region, it’s important to take your
                     time. Unlike other European cities where main sites and attractions
                      are clearly mapped out, Norway’s charm is in the fact that a
                       major part of your experience is the journey itself.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Another great thing about experiencing nature in Norway is that
                     many of the sites are free. You can rent a car for a minimal
                      fee and travel around the country, seeing fjords at every
                       turn and discovering waterfalls along the way. Be sure to
                        visit Geiranger where you’ll see both!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Did you know that Norway has its own breathtaking view of the
                     Northern Lights? If you enjoy hiking than you’ll love Norway’s
                      Pulpit Rock. Located in Stavanger, this rocky incline is
                       designed for hikers of all abilities. And the view at the
                        top will be well worth the effort.

            <div class="tips">
                <h1>2. Learn the Language</h1><br>
                <p>
                    This is an important tip when visiting any foreign land.
                     It’s helpful, and respectful, to learn at least a few
                      commonly used words.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Using the native language in Norway isn’t a must – most 
                    Norwegians speak fluent English. But wouldn’t it be nice
                     (and fun) to say thank you or ask a question in Norwegian?
                      The residents will be both impressed and appreciative of
                       your efforts.

            <div class="tips">
                <h1>3. Dress Warm</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Regardless of when your trip is scheduled, be sure to dress
                     warm when visiting Norway. The “hottest” month in the capital
                      of Oslo is July and high temperatures only reach 64 degrees.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The country, over all, sees high temperatures in the upper 60’s
                     and low 70’s. On occasion, temperatures will top out in the
                      80’s but this isn’t common. The warmth from the Gulf Stream
                       is what brings more mild weather to this northern nation.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The best time to visit Norway is between the months of May 
                    and September when the climate is mild. If you plan to visit 
                    in the winter months, be prepared. Temperatures can dip as 
                    low as 20 degrees.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    You also need to prepare for Norway’s Polar Nights and Midnight 
                    Sun. During Polar Nights parts of the country are blanketed in 
                    darkness for nearly 20 hours a day – twilight is the most light 
                    you’ll see. The Midnight Sun means exactly that – sunlight is 
                    visible 24 hours a day. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    This natural phenomenon is amazing and worth seeing, so be sure 
                    to check the region and how it’s effected before booking your trip.

                <h1>4. You can skip big cities</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Visiting Norway without seeing Oslo is not the same as traveling 
                    to France without visiting Paris. While Norway does have some 
                    charming cities, the main attraction here is the nature, so you 
                    really won’t be missing out on much if you skip the cities and 
                    head straight to the countryside.

                <h1>5. Public transport is slow</h1><br>
                <p>
                    If you’re planning to travel Norway by public transport, be 
                    aware that it will take a lot longer than by car and some bus 
                    routes to remote areas only go once or twice a day. If you can, 
                    try to rent a car for a few days to explore the countryside.

                <h1>6. Book your train tickets in advance</h1><br>
                <p>
                    You can book your train ticket up to three months in advance, 
                    and tickets tend to be a lot cheaper the earlier you book. The 
                    cheapest tickets are non-refundable so you’ll want to be sure 
                    of your travel dates, but as soon as you know for sure you should 
                    go ahead and buy those train tickets!

                <h1>7. Choose your season wisely</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Different seasons in Norway offer quite different travel experiences. 
                    In the summer and early autumn you can go hiking, in the winter we 
                    have lots of fun snow activities and the northern lights in the 
                    Arctic, and in the spring you can avoid the tourist crowds and 
                    often get better travel deals.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    But then you have to remember that from November to January Norway 
                    gets very little daylight, so you won’t have as much time to see 
                    the sights, and even in the summer nice weather is never guaranteed.
